A music playing voice assistant prototype.
commands:
  "play <song>"     plays the song
  "pause"           pauses the song
  "resume"          resumes the song if paused
  "stop"            stops the current song
  "define <word>"   gives the dictionary definition for a word
issues:
  This requires a lot of dependencies so to test it will require a fair amount of time and patience before you actually use it.
  This could be resolved by packaging it, but it's just a prototype project with minimal functionality so it is, as I see it, currently in no need of being made into an official application.
