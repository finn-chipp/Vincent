A music playing voice assistant prototype.\n
commands:
  1) "play <song>"     plays the song
  2) "pause"           pauses the song
  3) "resume"          resumes the song if paused
  4) "stop"            stops the current song
  5) "define <word>"   gives the dictionary definition for a word
issues:
  This requires a lot of dependencies so to test it will require a fair amount of time and patience before you actually use it.
  This could be resolved by packaging it, but it's just a prototype project with minimal functionality so it is, as I see it, currently in no need of being made into an official application.
